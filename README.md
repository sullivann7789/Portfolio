# Portfolio
## Portfolio Project Description
This project is a Developer Portfolio created to showcase my ability as a web developer. It includes HTML, and CSS; with various semantics, properties,
and methods which display a variety of skills which I have developed since my time studying under the UCSD Coding Boot Camp.

### Challenges and Advancements
As a beginner developer, I faced numerous learning and application challenges to accomplish what I set out to achieve with this project in particular. 

To be specific, I struggled particularly to keep everything flush and aesthetically appealing as I applied responsive design. With time and commitment, 
however, I was able to overcome this issue by applying several media queries targeted at various screen sizes, all popular in design. 

These devices include: the iPhone SE, iPad 3rd + 4th Generation, MacBook Pro, Samsung Galaxy S7, and standard desktop and laptop pixel sizes.

Furthermore, I faced challenges implementing advanced CSS rules, such as animation, mix-blend-mode, keyframes, transform, and psuedo-selectors. To achieve 
implementing these rules, I studied various sources, such as MDN web docs, W3 School, and css-tricks.com to ensure I was following the right syntax,
structure, units, references, and values in each selector and function. 

And of course, as most beginners, I also faced challenges with flex implementation and design. The dynamic aspects of flex and strict syntax flex requires
made it difficult to properly format my elements at the beginning of my project. But as thematic elements stay and challenges go away, with time, study, 
and reference I was able to overcome this difficulty as well. A huge resource I had to resolve this issue was with the instructors during after-hours at 
the UCSD Bootcamp course.

### Notable Features

In this project, it is highly encouraged for the user to interact and study the following features:

#### Header Animation and Interactivity:

- The Title of the Website is interactive, with a transformation function that allows the user to:
     - Change the font-color at two sections
     - Skew the text in a x, y, and z directions
     - This effect is responsive to various GUI px sizes
     
- The Title also is animated with a slide effect, crossing back and forth the left and right of the page along the x-axis
     - This effect is responsive to various GUI px sizes

#### Subheader Animation:

- The Navigation of the webpage contains an animation sequence where:
     - The two primary project nav-links approach the center of the page and appear over a 3-second animation sequence 
     - The Contact nav-link, and the Other Notable Project nav-link appear over a 5-second animation
     
#### Website-Launch Ability:

- The two real projects linked to the site: The Prework Study Guide Project, and The Horiseon Refactor Project, both launch when clicked to their actual live webpages

#### Background-Image and other Visual Effects:

- The Background of the page, instead of having one color, has been visually enhanced with an actual photo of myself standing at Potato Chip Rock to give a surreal sky affect to the page, as the screen size gets smaller, only the sky is shown as to not distract the user with too much imagery.

- The contact page displays a background image of a blackhole, to give an artistic interpretation of a portal, as well as the appearance of a magical realistic conceptualization of an eye peering back at the user from the abyss of space. I purposefully positioned this section in front of the boulder in the content background image to give the appearance of a face.

#### Various Hover Effects:

- All project elements, both the main projects, and the other notable projects, contain border and hover effects:
     - When hovering on the main projects, the border is lit up with a dark-red color.
     - When hovering on the other notable projects: the border is enlarged, the color changes along with the title color, and a purple background shadow          effect is displayed
     
#### Black-Cat Animation and Interactivity:

- When you hover on the black cat sticking it's head out of the Horiseon Refactor Project, it slowly creeps back behind the project page, and then back to it's original position. This was accomplished using: animation, keyframes, z-index, and mix-blend-mode. 

- When you hover on the Catch The Cat! title above the cat, the cat spits out a dialogue box of "Sucker!" for sincere comical effect. This only occurs on GUI above 1499 pixels in width. This was accomplished using the pseudo-selector hover, and also fine-tuning the border effect to achieve a dialogue-box appearance. 

#### Responsive Design:

- As previously mentioned, I was able to create a responsive environment for various device sizes, from widths ranging from 700 pixels to greater than 1670 pixels, all using the media query function in CSS. This took a lot of time and focus to accomplish, and I used the internet to get a list of different pixel dimensions for varying manufacturers and models. 

#### Oval Border Effect:

- I was able to achieve a oval/circle border effect by setting the border-radius to >=50%. This was particularly necessary in achieving the contact section which has the subtle appearance of an eye/portal.
