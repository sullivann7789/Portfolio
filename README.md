### Challenges and Advancements
As a beginner developer, I faced numerous learning and application challenges to accomplish what I set out to achieve with this project in particular. 

To be specific, I struggled particularly to keep everything flush and aesthetically appealing as I applied responsive design. With time and commitment, 
however, I was able to overcome this issue by applying several media queries targeted at various screen sizes, all popular in design. 

These devices include: the iPhone SE, iPad 3rd + 4th Generation, MacBook Pro, Samsung Galaxy S7, and standard desktop and laptop pixel sizes.

Furthermore, I faced challenges implementing advanced CSS rules, such as animation, mix-blend-mode, keyframes, transform, and psuedo-selectors. To achieve 
implementing these rules, I studied various sources, such as MDN web docs, W3 School, and css-tricks.com to ensure I was following the right syntax,
structure, units, references, and values in each selector and function. 

And of course, as most beginners, I also faced challenges with flex implementation and design. The dynamic aspects of flex and strict syntax flex requires
made it difficult to properly format my elements at the beginning of my project. But as thematic elements stay and challenges go away, with time, study, 
and reference I was able to overcome this difficulty as well. A huge resource I had to resolve this issue was with the instructors during after-hours at 
the UCSD Bootcamp course.
